# Jewels-Jewels

Please go to https://francoisboulou.github.io/Jewels-Jewels/ for the live version.
A simple static landing page for an online jewelry store. A version of this site was built by me for Ruby's Vintage, a small business in Salt Lake City, UT.

I am a fan of the Web Developer Roadmap (https://hackernoon.com/the-2019-web-developer-roadmap-ab89ac3c380e) and attempt to cover 
a few concepts in it with every project. The main ideas/technologies covered in this project are:

* Semantic HTML/Basic SEO
* Accessibility (Aria)
* Mobile first design/Media Queries
* Layouts (Flexbox)
* Animations
* CSS Preprocessing (LESS)
* DOM manipulation (JS/JQuery)
* Plugins/Libraries (Instafeed, Owl Carousel)
