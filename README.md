# Jewels-Jewels

Please go to https://francoisboulou.github.io/Jewels-Jewels/ for the live version.
A simple static landing page for an online jewelry store. A version of this site was built by me for Ruby's Vintage, a small business in Salt Lake City, UT.

I am a fan of the Web Developer Roadmap (https://hackernoon.com/the-2019-web-developer-roadmap-ab89ac3c380e) and attempt to cover 
a few concepts in it with every project. The main ideas/technologies covered in this project are:

* Semantic HTML/Basic SEO
* Accessibility (Aria/NVDA Screen Reader/Lighthouse Accessibility Audit)
* Mobile first design/Media Queries
* Layouts (Flexbox)
* Animations
* CSS Preprocessing (LESS)
* DOM manipulation (JS/JQuery)
* Plugins/Libraries (Instafeed, Owl Carousel) 

# Some Things I Did on This Project

* Used native, semantic HTML tags whenever possible, and Aria labels for custom elements, to increase screen reader compatibility
* Used NVDA screen reader to test the navigability of my site for non-sighted users
* Used JS and Jquery to dynamically add classes, control scroll behavior, and include a navigable, automatically updating instagram gallery
* Used media queries to create an easy to use layout on screen sizes ranging from the iPhone 4 to 4k monitors
* Made use of plugins such as Owl Carousel to add flair to the user experience

# Things Left to Do

* Add touch events to instafeed gallery for ease of use on mobile 
* Make better use of relative units and CSS calculation features for the best possible layout on every device
